My entries for the Global Game Jam

## 2019 Home

I created a cooperative, physics-based game for two players sharing one keyboard in 4.8 hours. 
In the game, you have one minute to attach the triangle (roof) on top of the square inside the green circle and build a home together.

## 2019 Home - WebRTC

Today (10/10/2019), I made a version of the game where you have to use your mobile phone to control the game. This version is really a proof-of-concept to get some experience with WebRTC. The game is not fully tested and error handling or lost connections are not correctly implemented.
