# 2019 Home

This is the first year that I participated in the Global GameJam 2019. I created the game “Reinder wants to go home, early” in 4.8 hours.

Participating in the Global GameJam 2019 (GGJ) was a really last-minute decision. Having the weekend already fully booked, I could only join on Friday evening and ended up doing a mini 4.8-hour solo jam.
